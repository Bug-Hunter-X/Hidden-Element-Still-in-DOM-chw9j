This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in HTML involving the incorrect removal of a DOM element using JavaScript. The element's display property is set to "none", but the element remains in the DOM.  This can lead to unexpected issues with event handling, styling, and other aspects of the application. The solution demonstrates the correct way to remove the element from the DOM entirely.
